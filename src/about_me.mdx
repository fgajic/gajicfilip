# About Page

I’m Filip Gajic, I’m currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at a leading FinTech firm specializing in financial crime, risk, and compliance solutions. Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated by computers, computer hardware, and how computers work. As time went on, I became interested in the software aspect of computers as well.  well.  

I took my first steps in programming back in elementary school, where I also represented my school in programming competitions and was very successful at them. In high school, I started exploring Linux and its distributions and took a step further in programming by learning Assembly, C, and Python.  

I began working as a System Administrator at a company in my city at the age of 19. By the time I was 20, I’d discovered what a DevOps Engineer actually does and dedicated all my free time to improving the necessary skills.  

Today, I'm doing what I love, but I'm still a hardware enthusiast, as I’m constantly upgrading something on my personal computer, and repairing computers for friends when needed.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, engaging in extreme sports, and writing posts for this blog. I’m also an amateur photographer, mostly taking landscape and street portrait pictures.
