# Hypervisor Technology and Implementation

## Core Architecture

The hypervisor layer functions as a hardware abstraction mechanism, utilizing CPU virtualization extensions and memory management units to partition physical resources. Through instruction set virtualization and memory page translation, the system orchestrates multiple isolated operating environments while maintaining dedicated resource allocations for each virtual instance.
